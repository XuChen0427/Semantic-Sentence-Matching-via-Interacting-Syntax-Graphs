Known as disuse syndrome , the deleterious effects of an imbalance between rest and physical activity include decreased physical work capacity , muscle atrophy , negative nitrogen and protein balance , cardiovascular deconditioning , pulmonary restrictions , and depression	Smoking tobaccowould most likely have a negative impact on the ability of an individual to succeed at physical activities because it it decreases stamina and cardiovascular efficiency	1	24876

Know terminology associated with sexual and asexual reproduction in trees	Trees send out rootlike extensions that produce new stems is an example of asexual reproduction	1	24878
The process begins with the many thousands of genes found in each cell of the human body	A single human body cell typically contains thousands of genes	0	24879
The rifting of continents that heralds the incipient formation of an ocean basin is usually accompanied by large amounts of volcanic activity	This process usually takes the longest amount of time : an ocean basin forms between two continents	1	24880
This common hand bone is proof that each of these mammalian species evolved from the same ancestor and further displays the evolution of organisms throughout history	The conclusion that two animal species evolved from a common ancestor in recent geological history is best supported by the observation that the species have similar bone structure	0	24881
The sun is in fact the only star in our solar system	Only the sun in our solar system give off their own light	1	24882
For a human , a mutation in a single gene containing , e g , 1000 bases , might take thousands of generations	A single human body cell typically contains thousands of genes	1	24883
The sun lies at the heart of the solar system , where it is by far the largest object	Only the sun in our solar system give off their own light	1	24884
The Solar System is the Sun and all the objects in orbit around it	Only the sun in our solar system give off their own light	1	24885
An eclipse of the Moon ( lunar eclipse ) is when the Earth 's shadow falls on the Moon	When earth ’ s shadow falls on the moon , the shadow causes a lunar eclipse	0	24886
This produces new plants by vegetative propagation , a form of asexual reproduction	Trees send out rootlike extensions that produce new stems is an example of asexual reproduction	1	24887
These suggest that the Lau Basin has formed following a two stage process of arc rifting , followed by extension via a southward propagating oceanic ridge system	This process usually takes the longest amount of time : an ocean basin forms between two continents	1	24888
There are many invertebrates , including sea stars and sea anemones for example , that produce by asexual reproduction	Trees send out rootlike extensions that produce new stems is an example of asexual reproduction	1	24889
When the Moon passes behind the Earth 's shadow , that is called a lunar eclipse	When earth ’ s shadow falls on the moon , the shadow causes a lunar eclipse	0	24890
Hinder recreational activities Habitat alterations may have impacts on fish and spawning grounds , thus decreasing fish populations Reduction in bird population for hunting Recreational activities like fishing and hunting are physically obstructed 4	Smoking tobaccowould most likely have a negative impact on the ability of an individual to succeed at physical activities because it it decreases stamina and cardiovascular efficiency	1	24891
Smoking reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen and increases the heart rate and basal metabolic rate , thus counteracting the benefits of physical activity , including cardiovascular fitness	Smoking tobaccowould most likely have a negative impact on the ability of an individual to succeed at physical activities because it it decreases stamina and cardiovascular efficiency	0	24892
Genes tell the cell how to make the thousands of proteins in your body	A single human body cell typically contains thousands of genes	1	24893
Only since the 1980s have reconstructions , based on significant amounts of data , shown the paths of the continents and the ages of the ocean basins	This process usually takes the longest amount of time : an ocean basin forms between two continents	1	24894
The Web has several good sites giving details about solar system objects ( Sun , planets , satellites , etc )	Only the sun in our solar system give off their own light	1	24895
Since the amount of time we ( usually ) spend processing the data is negligible compared to the amount of time DOS takes to return or write the data , reading two characters at a time will essentially double the speed of the program	This process usually takes the longest amount of time : an ocean basin forms between two continents	1	24896
